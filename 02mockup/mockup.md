# In A Nutshell
Empower/democratize citizens to take to their council about the importance of transport planning 
understand what are the good ingredients for a good transport system

# Design Brief of Visualisation
-Gamified scenarios of real world case studies?
-An AR effect of "What If"s Scenarios
-Educational Reference Tool
-ASEAN infrastructure master plan

### Swiss Cheese Approach:
Even without generating routes, the layers can be toggled to illustrate hypothetical routes.

### Extension Consideration:
Without restricting users to 1 single route, an array of routes can be "drawn", each reflecting the strength of each line.
ie. 1 route that is has the lowest tsunami risk; another route having the shortest distance.
