# In A Nutshell
-Transport Challenges in Southeast Asia: Natural barriers, political fragmentation, and economic disparities hinder development of cohesive transport networks, leaving many regions underserved.

-Empowering Communities with Visualization Tools: A "what-if" scenario generator helps local communities, especially in neglected areas, visualize infrastructure impacts and and be responsive to the needs of all communities, not just those in urban or economically dominant areas.

-Simplification for Engagement: Real-world scenarios from complex data are made relatable, allowing users to explore regional constraints like flooding and environmental impact.

-Democratizing Expertise: Gamification allows non-experts to learn through simulation, empowering underserved communities to advocate for projects that address their specific context.


#### Design Brief
A **"What-if" scenario** visualization tool 

**for** local communities, grassroots organizations, and technical planners 

**in** Southeast Asia.

**with** criterias in line with ASEAN infrastructure Master Plan / Southeast Asian context

### Swiss Cheese Approach:
![mock-final_swiss cheese](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a7113f9-2cb4-46c9-bc5a-af9e78ec07a3)
Even without generating routes, the layers can be toggled to illustrate hypothetical routes.

### Extension Consideration:
![mock-final_alt results](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c128994c-8783-4fea-9b5a-afb76d717ef8)
Without restricting users to 1 single route, an array of routes can be "drawn", each reflecting the strength of each line.
ie. 1 route that is has the lowest tsunami risk; another route having the shortest distance.

## Disclaimer
Due to numerous expertise involved in projects of such scale, it is prudent to note that this Visualization will serve as a what if scenario and democratize [what, tell me] to underserved and neglected regions  can you elaborate this
Given the multidisciplinary nature of such projects, the visualization tool proposed would not replace expert decision-making but rather serve as a "what-if" scenario generator. 


Your professor’s point highlights the complexity of large-scale infrastructure projects, which often require input from a wide range of experts—engineers, urban planners, environmental scientists, economists, and policymakers, among others. Given this multidisciplinary nature, the visualization tool you’re proposing would not replace expert decision-making but rather serve as a "what-if" scenario generator. This means it would allow stakeholders to explore different possibilities, test assumptions, and simulate outcomes based on varying parameters (e.g., budget constraints, environmental factors, or population needs).
