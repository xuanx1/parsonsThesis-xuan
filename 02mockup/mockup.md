# In A Nutshell
-Transport Challenges in Southeast Asia: Natural barriers, political fragmentation, and economic disparities hinder development of cohesive transport networks, leaving many regions underserved.

-Empowering Communities with Visualization Tools: A "what-if" scenario generator helps local communities, especially in neglected areas, visualize infrastructure impacts and be responsive to the needs of all communities, not just those in urban or economically dominant areas.

-Simplification for Engagement: Real-world scenarios from complex data are made relatable, allowing users to explore regional constraints like flooding and environmental impact.

-Democratizing Expertise: Gamification allows non-experts to learn through simulation, empowering underserved communities to advocate for projects that address their specific context.


#### Design Brief
A **"What-if" scenario** visualization tool 

**for** local communities, grassroots organizations, and technical planners 

**in** Southeast Asia.

**with** criterias in line with ASEAN infrastructure Master Plan / Southeast Asian context

### Swiss Cheese Approach:
![mock-final_swiss cheese](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a7113f9-2cb4-46c9-bc5a-af9e78ec07a3)
Even without generating routes, the layers can be toggled to illustrate hypothetical routes.

### Extension Considered:
![mock-final_alt results](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c128994c-8783-4fea-9b5a-afb76d717ef8)
Without restricting users to 1 single route, an array of routes can be "drawn", each reflecting the strength of each line.
ie. 1 route that is has the lowest tsunami risk; another route having the shortest distance.

## Exported Report
![mock-final_report](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84bf8279-f7f8-4d46-a197-7b8478efe428)

Station placement is determined based on population density thresholds and interval distances, which are then visualised on the route adjacent to the terrain elevation.
The 1st page provides an overview of the report, while the 2nd page includes a more detailed diagram when it comes to visualisation of the variance of terrain elevation and population spreads.


## Disclaimer
Given the multidisciplinary nature and numerous expertise involved—engineers, urban planners, environmental scientists, economists, and policymakers, in projects of such scale, it is prudent to note that this Visualization will serve as a "What-if" scenario and democratize access to information and decision-making tools. This would allow stakeholders to explore different possibilities, test assumptions, and simulate outcomes based on varying parameters (e.g. environmental factors or population needs) while fostering greater public engagement and planning that's aligned with the realities of Southeast Asia’s landscapes and communities.
