# Trains, Lanes, and Data Grains
### Mapping Southeast Asia‚Äôs Future

A speculative exploratory urban planning engine designed for activists, policymakers, and city planners looking to shake things up. Forecasting rail connectivity development in Southeast Asia, this tool is like SimCity meets real-world infrastructure‚Äîexcept the stakes are higher.

By transforming biodiversity and census data into hypothetical ‚ÄúWhat-if‚Äù scenarios, it reveals indiscernible pathways through challenging terrains and natural hazards like earthquakes. Whether advocating for underserved communities or optimizing railway routes, users can explore how data-driven urban futures can reshape regional connectivity.

What if you could find the best-fit route that maximizes services to the majority of the population while avoiding seasonal hurricanes?

Prior to commencing the construction of a rail network, feasibility studies are conducted. These studies include terrain analysis, identifying surrounding population clusters, and even weather conditions. A significant amount of investments, resources, and labor are dedicated to this rigorous pre-selection process. 
 
Given the geographical and socio-political challenges native to Southeast Asia‚Äîranging from unique terrains to fragmented governance‚Äî and the political risks associated with large infrastructure projects, incorporating a data-driven calculator into the pre-selection process can increase engagement to underserved regions, maximise structure longevity and have greater consideration towards sustainable infrastructure planning, while weighing the risks specific to Southeast Asia‚Äîall of which are keys in the potential realisation of such hypothetical connectivity projects.

This project aims to develop a rail routing calculator for the general public, primarily rail enthusiasts, to route train lines and determine station placements with conditions specific to Southeast Asia. Instead of focusing solely on economically dominant areas, this "what-if" scenario helps bring attention to neglected regions by leveraging data such as ground elevation and earthquake safety distances and propose a few options of varying strengths of rail routes from Point A to Point B, which are then weighted against a final, feasibility score that is computed based on its constituent criteria.

## 1. Introduction
#### 1.1  Costs of Infrastructure Projects in the Southeast Asian Context
Historically, Southeast Asia has struggled to develop cohesive transport networks due to natural barriers, political fragmentation, and economic disparities, which has contributed to poor urban planning and underutilized transport routes. Such pan-regional infrastructure generally requires substantial amount of funding, time and resources.

The region‚Äôs terrain, ranging from rainforests to river deltas along with its weather, characterized by monsoon seasons and high humidity‚Äîintroduces new challenges to the durability and maintenance of existing infrastructure as deterioration through flooding and high humidity, has led to a necessity for frequent maintenance work and in return, their associated costs.

One of the keys to making these projects worthwhile; maximizing their utility within their limited shelf life; is to place more emphasis on the quality and inclusiveness of its planning ‚Äî to get as many Southeast Asians onboard as possible.

 
#### 1.2 Project Scope
This project, inspired by the rapid urbanization and infrastructure challenges in Southeast Asia, where uneven development has led to economic disparities and access to resources, aims to develop a data visualization-based calculator that seeks to democratize civil projects in regards to public transport lines and station placements planning across Southeast Asia.

One of the key challenges amongst infrastructure projects is public perception‚Äîmany believe such projects are too ambitious, complex or costly to execute. This calculator we will develop uses combinatorial optimization‚Äîcalled the ‚Äúslime mold‚Äù as it is a natural organism known for its efficient network-building capabilities. In the name of biomimicry, this concept is applied in this context; to propose the most sensible curvature of a rail network to be constructed, demonstrating that infrastructure planning is "not as hard as we think," even in natural disasters prone environments like Southeast Asia, where factors such as tsunami can significantly impact planning doctrine.

By visualizing these factors, the tool weighs the risks and challenges specific to Southeast Asia to assist in routing train lines and determine station placements and gauges the likelihood of the realisation of such hypothetical connectivity projects.

Historically, the focus on railway expansion has always been solely on economically dominant areas. This "what-if" scenario helps bring attention to neglected regions and propose a few options of ‚ÄúBest Fit Curve‚Äù, each with their own varying strengths of rail routes from Point A to Point B, which are then weighted against a final, feasibility score that is computed based on its constituent criteria. By incorporating data and deriving its results, this not only allows a more inclusive infrastructure planning but also translates to the eventual ease of movement for human capital, services, and resources, facilitating economic integration in Southeast Asia.

#### 2.3 Final Feasibility Index
In this context, the 5 constituent indexes are combined, forming a new index which determines the score of the route from Point A to Point B. The goal is to minimise construction effort (ie. distance, terrain difficulty) while maximising regional connectivity, economic impact, and population engagement. The value here states how well the route adheres to identified constraints such as geographical hazards, population coverage, and structural resilience as the algorithm avoids areas prone to flooding or tsunamis

The Final Feasibility Index is an index that aggregates and integrates all 5 indexes into a single score:

**1. Tsunami Risk Index** (Hazard Vulnerability)

**2. Structure Durability Index** (Structural Resilience)

**3. Environmental Impact Index** (Environmental Sustainability)

**4. Operability Index** (Overall Usefulness)

**5. Population-Economic Importance Index** (Economic and Demographic Value)

The weightage assigned to each of the 5 indexes in the Final Feasibility Index is based on its significance when it comes to the feasibility of the route. 

The Tsunami Risk Index (TSI), Population-Economic Importance Index (PEI), and Structure Durability Index (SDI) are all weighted the same due to an equal emphasis on safety and prioritization serving the majority of the population, which is essential for long-term viability (Jonkman et al. 2005). 

The Operability Index (OPI) is weighted the highest as it directly affects the functionality and accessibility of the area, with access to emergency services being critical to its success as a conduit (OECD 2020). The Environmental Impact Index (E2I) is weighted the lowest as environmental sustainability is crucial but less immediately impactful in the operational aspects of such connection (World Bank 2020). 

**In the FFI, the higher the value, the more feasible the project.**

 $$
 FFI = 0.2 \times (\text{Tsunami Risk Index}) + 0.2 \times (\text{Structure Durability Index}) + 0.15 \times (\text{Environmental Impact Index}) + 0.25 \times (\text{Operability Index}) + 0.2 \times (\text{Population-Economic Importance Index})
 $$

| **Feasibility Final Score** (Min 0 - Max 1) | **Interpretation** (aka Reality Check) |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **"Why Bother?" Tier** (0.00 - 0.33) | Costs more than your annual coffee budget. Requires solving cold fusion. Permitting process involves blood sacrifices. |
| **"Maybe If We Stretch" Tier** (0.34 - 0.66) | Budget will hurt but won't kill you. Engineers will complain but do it. Only needs 3 miracle approvals. |
| **"Shut Up and Take My Money" Tier** (0.67 - 1.0) | Basically IKEA assembly instructions. Approval process involves one bored intern. ROI before lunch. |

#### 5.2 Usage Demonstration
+ 4min mp4

#### 5.3 Conclusion
The project demonstrates that combinatorial optimization can be a powerful tool in planning public transport networks in Southeast Asia, particularly in the face of the region's challenging terrain and climate. By integrating indexes and key indicators, the tool provides a data-driven approach to rail line and station placement. The proposed rail network gives space for the general public to conceptualise hypothetic connections that has yet to exist but should have existed.

#### 5.4 Disclaimer
Given the multidisciplinary nature and numerous expertise involved‚Äîengineers, urban planners, environmental scientists and policymakers, in projects of such scale, it is prudent to note that this visualization will serve as a hypothetical planning tool that democratize access to information necessary to its realisation. This would allow the public to explore different possibilities and simulate outcomes based on varying parameters (e.g. environmental factors, or population needs), while considering factors and challenges specific to Southeast Asia.
