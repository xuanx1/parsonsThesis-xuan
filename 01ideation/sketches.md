Integrating geographical and infrastructural data layers for decision-making, the key factors affecting railway planning are outlined and prioritized, using raw data such as elevation, and population density before normalizing them into an index and a scoring system such as environmental impact grading.

## Perspectives

The explores a minimal approach to creating depth through the use of perspective distortion, introducing the tool in 3 major components - report of the analysis of the route; settings panels for customization and optimization of the route; 2d elevation plan which mirrors the path which is usually shown from the top, neglecting the fact that there are challenges stemming from the cross-section of the terrain.

## Tiles

This concept mimics a dashboard that exposes all the settings and adjustments to the user, which hints that it is not for the novice.

Reversing the processes of the first and second concept, this concept explores using an overview, blueprint-style theme with bright highlighted routes, focusing on node-based planning and infrastructure adjustments.
