A speculative exploratory urban planning engine designed for activists, policymakers, and city planners looking to shake things up. Forecasting rail connectivity development in Southeast Asia, this tool is like SimCity meets real-world infrastructure—except the stakes are higher.

By transforming biodiversity and census data into hypothetical “What-if” scenarios, it reveals indiscernible pathways through challenging terrains and natural hazards like earthquakes. Whether advocating for underserved communities or optimizing railway routes, users can explore how data-driven urban futures can reshape regional connectivity.

What if you could find the best-fit route that maximizes services to the majority of the population while avoiding seasonal hurricanes?
