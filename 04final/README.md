### Trains, Lanes, and Data Grains: Mapping the Future of Southeast Asia’s Rail Connectivity

This speculative urban planning engine offers a dynamic exploration of rail connectivity development in Southeast Asia, blending real-world infrastructure challenges with a data-driven approach. Like SimCity, but with real stakes, the tool visualizes how rail networks could evolve based on environmental, demographic, and economic factors.

At its core, the engine transforms biodiversity and census data into interactive “What-if” scenarios, revealing hidden pathways through complex landscapes—from dense urban centers to remote, underserved regions. It also accounts for natural hazards like earthquakes and seasonal hurricanes, providing a realistic assessment of risks and opportunities.

With interactive features, users can zoom into specific regions, filter by key variables like population density or environmental constraints, and simulate different infrastructure scenarios. Whether advocating for equitable transit access, optimizing railway routes, or forecasting long-term urban expansion, this tool provides a macro and micro perspective on regional connectivity.
